    "At the same time, Python was designed to be more human-readable than other languages like C++ and Java.\n",
    "It uses different syntax than those languages to give programs a clear, logical flow and a preference for words over symbols.\n",
    "Python is also [object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), but we won't talk about that in detail until much later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do you get Python?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different distributions of Python available, including a very popular one called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) that you will probably run across in internet searches during this class.\n",
    "Typically to use Python you need to install it on your local machine.\n",
    "The Anaconda installer is about 500 MB, so this is not a trivial ask (although Mac OS comes with a Python distribution pre-installed)."
